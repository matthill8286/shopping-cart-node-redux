## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn` or `npm -i`

Great start to get everything we need

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br> 
And will start run the server `concurrently` for the grocery products demo, [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### Futher steps
